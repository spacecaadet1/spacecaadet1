- 👋 Hi, I’m @spacecaadet1
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and potentially making this a full time job. I'm trying to learn more skills so that i could escape my situation
in my country and move abroad to a better life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and planning to learn js and c++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would make me a better programmer
- 📫 How to reach me @spacecaadett on insta, i dont have many social media and i barely use them, so instagram is the easiest way.
